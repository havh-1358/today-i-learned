Structure and Unions are important datatypes.

**Structure** is simply a group of variab les, which can be of the same or
different datatypes.

**Union** are much the same as structures. However, in a union, all of the
member variables share the same memory location. By storing var in this way,
unions allow you to specify the same value in different types.
