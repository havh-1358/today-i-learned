Normaly, we call i18n by using: ```t "user.new.new_user"```, but it's quite long.

First, we need to add this line to ```config/application.rb```
```Ruby
config.i18n.load_path += Dir["#{Rails.root.to_s}/config/locales/**/*.{rb,yml}"]
```
After that, we need to manage config/locale folder like:

```
config/locale
  -views
    en.yml
  - controller
```

On en.yml file:
```
en:
  users:
    new:
      new_user: "New User"
```

Now, we can call "New User" by using: ```t ".new_user"``` on
views/users/new.html.erb
