Vim stores all changed postions in a changelist. You can show all changed postions by command `:changes`

To jump to a change postion, use the command `g;` or `g,`

To move forward or backward form jumplist, use the command `C-i` and `C-o`.
You can find the jumps list with command `:jumps`

You should read the this help for more informations:

```
:help changelist

```

Be happy with VIM!!! :)
