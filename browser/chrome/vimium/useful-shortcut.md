# Useful Shortcut

Some useful shortcut I found today:

* `T` - Search through opened tabs
* `f` to show hint links and press `Ctr + <hint>` to open and switch to new tab
* `gv` or `^` - Go to previously-visted tab
* `m` - Create a new mark
* ``` - Go to mark
* `b` and `B` - Open a bookmark in current/new tab
* `<<`, `>>` - Move tab to left/right
