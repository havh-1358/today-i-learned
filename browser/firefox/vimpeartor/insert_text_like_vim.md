On firefox, you can type text like on vim by using ```vimpeartor``` plugin and
TextArea feature.

To enter the TextArea feature, you must focus on the input text box.

```C-t``` to turn on Text area. Now you can use vim feature like: ```cw```, ```f
+ character```, ```yy```, ```dd```, ....

or you can press ```C-i``` to edit text on gvim.

Awesome!!! ^^
